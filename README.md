Course-Notes
============

## Overview

These are my notes that are usually written after lectures while the material is still fresh. I enjoy experimenting with various note-taking styles, and the format of my notes differ from term to term. If you spot any errors or have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

## Usage

All the notes are compiled to PDF format with pdfLaTeX. If you with to modify the original tex files, please include it in the same directory as the yingconfig.sty file.
