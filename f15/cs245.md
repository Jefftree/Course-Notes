## Propositional Logic
**Logic** is the systematic study of the principles of reasoning and inference.
- Used for modeling computer hardware, software, and embedded systems.
- Designing systems that can apply reason and inferences (artificial intelligence)

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**.

A logic is formalized for syntax, semantics, and proof procedures.

## Syntax
Atomic propositions are combined into compound propositions, and are analyzed as a set of interrelated propositions.

**Propositions** are represented by formulas which contains a sequence of symbols. An **expression** is a finite sequence of symbols.
- Propositional variables - Denoted with lowercase Roman letters
- Connectives - Logic operators (NOT, AND, OR)
- Punctuation - Brackets

**Binary** connectives (AND, OR, IMPLIES) apply to two things.
**Unary** connectives (NOT) are only applied to one.

A **formula** can be built from a set of proposition variables.
A formula can be atom, negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication. It should only take on the type of the outermost type.

**Example**:
$(p ^ q) --> r $ is an implication.

## Semantics
The **semantics** of a logic describes how to interpret the well-formed formulas of the logic.

A **truth valuation** is a function with the set of all proposition symbols as domain and assigns a truth value (T,F) to each propositional variable.

Everything  can be built from the nand symbol. (see computer boolean)
