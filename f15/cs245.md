## Propositional Logic
**Logic** is the systematic study of the principles of reasoning and inference.
- Used for modeling computer hardware, software, and embedded systems.
- Designing systems that can apply reason and inferences (artificial intelligence)

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**.


## English to Propositional Logic

$\lnot p$: not p, it is not the case of p

$p \land q$: p and q, p but q, not only p but q, p while q, p despite q, p yet q, p although q

$p \lor q$: p or q, p and/or q, p unless q

$p \implies q$: if p then q, q if p, p only if q, q when p, p is sufficient for q, q is necessary for p

$p \iff q$: p if and only if q, p is equivalent to q, p exactly if q, p is necessary and sufficient for q

A logic is formalized for syntax, semantics, and proof procedures.

## Syntax
Atomic propositions are combined into compound propositions, and are analyzed as a set of interrelated propositions.

**Propositions** are represented by formulas which contains a sequence of symbols. An **expression** is a finite sequence of symbols.
- Propositional variables - Denoted with lowercase Roman letters
- Connectives - Logic operators (NOT, AND, OR)
- Punctuation - Brackets

**Binary** connectives (AND, OR, IMPLIES) apply to two things.
**Unary** connectives (NOT) are only applied to one.

A **formula** can be built from a set of proposition variables.
A formula can be atom, negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication. It should only take on the type of the outermost type.

**Example**:
$(p \land q) \implies r $ is an implication.

## Semantics
The **semantics** of a logic describes how to interpret the well-formed formulas of the logic.

A **truth valuation** is a function with the set of all proposition symbols as domain and assigns a truth value (T,F) to each propositional variable.

For example $t(p) = p^t = T$

Everything can be built from the nand symbol. (see computer boolean)

To prove theorems, mathematical induction is used.

**Principle of Mathematical Induction:**

Establish that the base case has a property $P$. Show that if the property holds for the base case, the next number also holds the property. Conclude that the property holds for all $n \in N,n \geq BC$

**Theorem**: Let $R$ be a property, suppose that

1. for each atomic formula $p$, we have $R(p)$
2. For each formula $\alpha$, if $R(\alpha)$ then $R((\lnot \alpha))$
3. For each pair of formulas $\alpha$ and $n$, and each connective $*$, if $R(\alpha)$ and $R(n)$, then $R((\alpha * n))$.

This is called **structural induction**.

## Working with Formulas

A formula $\alpha$ is a **tautology** if and only if for every truth valuation $t$, $\alpha^t = T$

A formula $\alpha$ is a **contradiction** if and only if for every truth valuation $t$, $\alpha^t=F$. Example: $p \land \lnot p$

A formula $\alpha$ is **satisfiable** if and only if there is some truth valuation $t$, such that $\alpha^t=T$

**Note:** A formula is satisfiable if and only if it is not a contradiction.

A **valuation tree** is a shortcut to analyzing what would happen if the entire truth table was filled out.

Two formulas are **equivalent**, $\alpha \equiv \beta$ if $\alpha^t = \beta^t$ for every valuation $t$.

**Lemma:** Suppose that $\alpha \equiv \beta$. Then for any formula $\gamma$, and any connective $*$, the formula $\alpha * \gamma$ and $\beta * \gamma$ are equivalent.

$$\alpha * \gamma \equiv \beta * \gamma*$$


**Example:** Prove
$(p \land q) \lor (q \land r) \equiv (q \land (p \lor r))$

**Proof**:
$= (p \land q) \lor (q \land r)$

$= (q \land p) \lor (q \land r)$

$= (q \land (p \lor r))$


**Simplify**: $p \lor (p \land q)$

**Solution:**

$= (p \land T) \lor (p \land q)$

$= p \land (T \lor q)$

$=p$

## Class

Prove $\lnot(((\lnot p \lor q) \lor r) \land \lnot r \land p) \lor q$

**Example:** Prove or disprove $p \equiv p \land (q \implies p)$

$p \land (q \implies p)$

$p \land (q \lor \lnot p)$ Implication

$p \land (\lnot p \lor q)$ Commutativity

$p$ Simplification II

LHS=RHS

**Example:** Prove or disprove $p \land (\lnot (\lnot q \land \lnot p) \lor p) \equiv q$

**Solution:** Find an counter example. Select $t(p) = F, t(q) = T$. LHS = F, RHS = T

Alternatively, simplify first if a value cannot be found by inspection.

$p \land ((q \lor p) \lor p)$

$p \land (q \lor (p \lor p))$

$p \land (q \lor p)$

$p \land (p \lor q)$

$p$

## Logical Consequence

Let $\sigma$ be a set of formulas and let $\phi$ be a formula. We say that

- $\phi$ is a logical consequence of $\sigma$ or
- $\sigma$ semantically entails $\phi$, or
- in symbols, $\sigma |= \phi$

if and and only if for any truth value $t$

$$\sigma^t = T \implies\phi^t = T$$

**Example:**

$$\{(p \implies q),q\} |= q$$

**Solution:** Whenever $\{(p \implies q),q\}$, $q$ must be true. This can be shown from drawing a truth table.

**Example:** $\{p \implies q, q\} |\not= p$

**Solution:** When $p = F,q = T$, and the proposition does not hold.


**Example:**
$$\{(p \implies q), (q \implies r)\} |= (r \implies q)$$

**Solution:** Draw huge truth table. $p=F,q=F,r=T$ has $\sigma^t = T$ and $\phi^t = F$

**Note:** If $\sigma$ is a contradiction, $\sigma |= \phi$ will always be true.

## Dealing with Code

If statement fragments can be simplified by drawing a truth table and taking the simplest expressions. The **else** block should be the largest block to avoid writing extra code.

##

Formulas $\alpha \implies \beta$ and $\lnot\alpha \lor \beta$ are equivalent.
Thus $\impies$ is said to be **definable** in terms of $\lnot$ and $\lor$.

There are sixteen possible binary connectives. (16 because there are 16 way to permutate T and F over the truth table containing 4 slots. Two are nullary (ignores the value they connect), and four others are unary (ignore one value but not the other).

A set of connectives is **adequate** iff any $n$-ary $(n\geq 1)$ connective can be defined in terms of ones in the set.

$(\lor,\land,\lnot)$ is an adequate set of connectives.

$(\land,\lnot)$,$(\lor,\lnot)$,$(\implies,\lnot)$ are adequate sets of connectives.

## Section

A **proof** is a formal demonstration that a statement is true. I

- It must be mechanically checkable. Intuition and insight should not be necessary.
- Any computer could verify its correctness

A proof is generally syntactic, rather than semantic. Permits mechanical checking. Rules chosen for semantic reasons.

A proof consists of a list of formulas. Assumption $\rightarrow$ inference $\rightarrow$ inference rules $\rightarrow $ conclusion.

A set of inference rules defines a **proof system**.

We notate "there is a proof with assumptions $\sum$ and conclusion $\phi$" by $\sum \vdash \phi$

An inference rule is written as

$$\frac{a_1\qquad a_2 \cdots a_i}{\beta}$$

This means, suppose each formula in $\alpha$ already appears in the proof (either assumed or previously inferred), then one may infer the formula $\beta$

Example $\frac{\alpha \, \beta}{\alpha \land \beta}$

## Approaches to Proofs

Direct proof. Establish $\sum \vDash \phi$. Give a proof with $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n$ as assumptions and obtain $\phi$ as conclusion.

Refutations (indirect proofs, proof by contradiction)

Establish $\sum \vDash \phi$. Assume $\lnot \phi$ and $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n$ and obtain a contradiction as conclusion. This works because any valuation that makes $\sum$ true must make $\lnot \phi$ false and make $\phi$ true.

**Resolution** is a refutation system with the following influence rule.

$\frac{a \lor p \,\, \lnot p \land b}{a \lor b}$

for any variable $p$ and formula $a$ and $b$.

Consider the following as special cases

Unit Resolution $\frac{a \lor p\qquad \lnot p}{a}$

Contradiction: $\frac{p\qquad \lnot p}{\text{Contradiction}}$

## Resolution

To prove $\{p,q\}_{\text{res}} p \land q$, derive a contradiction from the assumptions $\{p,q,\lnot(p\land q)\}$

Conjunctive normal form


- A **literal** is a (propositional) variable or the negation of a variable
- A **clause** is a disjunction of literals (cannot use and)
- A formula is in **conjunctive normal form** if it is a conjunction of clauses.

A formula is in CNF if and only if

- its only connectives are $\lnot, \lor, \land$
- $\lnot$ applies only to variables
- $\lor$ applies only to subformulas with no occurrence of $\land$.

To prove  $\phi$ from $\sum$ via resolution refutation

- Convert each formula in $\sum$ to CNF
- Convert $\lnot \phi$ to CNF
- Split the CNF formulas as the $\land$s, yielding a set of clauses
- From the resulting set of clauses, keep applying the resolution inference rule until
    + The empty clause (contradiction) results ($\phi$ is a theorem)
    + The rule cannot be applied to give a new formula ($\phi$ is not a theorem)

## Interpretation

Fix a set $C$ of constant symbols, function symbols, and relation symbols.

An interpretation $M$ for the set $C$ consists of

- A non empty set dom($M$), called the domain of $M$
- For each constant $c$, a member $c^M$ of dom($M$)
- For each function symbol $f^{(i)}$, an iary function $f^M$
- For each relation symbol $R^{(i)}$, an iary function relation $R^M$

An interpretation is also called a model.

## Syntax

An **environment** is a function that assigns a value in the domain to each variable.

Example: With domain $N$, we might have environment $\theta_1$, given by $\theta_1(x) = 9$ and $\theta_1(y)=2$.
