## Propositional Logic
**Logic** is the systematic study of the principles of reasoning and inference.
- Used for modeling computer hardware, software, and embedded systems.
- Designing systems that can apply reason and inferences (artificial intelligence)

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**.


## English to Propositional Logic

$\lnot p$: not p, it is not the case of p

$p \land q$: p and q, p but q, not only p but q, p while q, p despite q, p yet q, p although q

$p \lor q$: p or q, p and/or q, p unless q

$p \implies q$: if p then q, q if p, p only if q, q when p, p is sufficient for q, q is necessary for p

$p \iff q$: p if and only if q, p is equivalent to q, p exactly if q, p is necessary and sufficient for q

A logic is formalized for syntax, semantics, and proof procedures.

## Syntax
Atomic propositions are combined into compound propositions, and are analyzed as a set of interrelated propositions.

**Propositions** are represented by formulas which contains a sequence of symbols. An **expression** is a finite sequence of symbols.
- Propositional variables - Denoted with lowercase Roman letters
- Connectives - Logic operators (NOT, AND, OR)
- Punctuation - Brackets

**Binary** connectives (AND, OR, IMPLIES) apply to two things.
**Unary** connectives (NOT) are only applied to one.

A **formula** can be built from a set of proposition variables.
A formula can be atom, negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication. It should only take on the type of the outermost type.

**Example**:
$(p \land q) \implies r $ is an implication.

## Semantics
The **semantics** of a logic describes how to interpret the well-formed formulas of the logic.

A **truth valuation** is a function with the set of all proposition symbols as domain and assigns a truth value (T,F) to each propositional variable.

For example $t(p) = p^t = T$

Everything can be built from the nand symbol. (see computer boolean)

To prove theorems, mathematical induction is used.

**Principle of Mathematical Induction:**

Establish that the base case has a property $P$. Show that if the property holds for the base case, the next number also holds the property. Conclude that the property holds for all $n \in N,n \geq BC$

**Theorem**: Let $R$ be a property, suppose that

1. for each atomic formula $p$, we have $R(p)$
2. For each formula $\alpha$, if $R(\alpha)$ then $R((\lnot \alpha))$
3. For each pair of formulas $\alpha$ and $n$, and each connective $*$, if $R(\alpha)$ and $R(n)$, then $R((\alpha * n))$.

This is called **structural induction**.

## Working with Formulas

A formula $\alpha$ is a **tautology** if and only if for every truth valuation $t$, $\alpha^t = T$

A formula $\alpha$ is a **contradiction** if and only if for every truth valuation $t$, $\alpha^t=F$. Example: $p \land \lnot p$

A formula $\alpha$ is **satisfiable** if and only if there is some truth valuation $t$, such that $\alpha^t=T$

**Note:** A formula is satisfiable if and only if it is not a contradiction.

A **valuation tree** is a shortcut to analyzing what would happen if the entire truth table was filled out.

Two formulas are **equivalent**, $\alpha \equiv \beta$ if $\alpha^t = \beta^t$ for every valuation $t$.

**Lemma:** Suppose that $\alpha \equiv \beta$. Then for any formula $\gamma$, and any connective $*$, the formula $\alpha * \gamma$ and $\beta * \gamma$ are equivalent.

$$\alpha * \gamma \equiv \beta * \gamma*$$


**Example:** Prove
$(p \land q) \lor (q \land r) \equiv (q \land (p \lor r))$

**Proof**:
$(p \land q) \lor (q \land r)$

$(q \land p) \lor (q \land r)$

$(q \land (p \lor r))$


$p \lor (p \land q)$

$(p \land T) \lor (p \land q)$

$p \land (T \lor q)$

$p$
