## ECON 101

**Scarcity** is the inability to satisfy all wants. Must make **choices** based on **incentives**.

Economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile these choices.

**Variations**

- Alfred Marshall defines economics as the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.
- Jacob Viner: Economics is what economist do
- Jim Duesenberry: Economics is about how people make choices. Sociology is about why there isn't any choice to be made.
- John Maynard Keynes: The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, a technique of thinking that helps its possessors to draw correct conclusions.
- Lionel Robbin: Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

**Microeconomics:** Study of choices that individuals and businesses make, how those choices interact in markets, and the influence of governments.

**Macroeconomics:** Study of the overall performance of an economy (National and global)

**Goods and services** are the objects that people value and produce to satisfy human wants.

In China, agriculture accounts for 11%, manufactured goods 49%, and services 40%

In Canada, agriculture accounts for 2% of total production, manufactured goods 20%, and services 78%.


Goods and services are produced by using productive resources called **factors of production**. They are grouped into four categories

- Land (Gift of nature)
- Labour (Time and effort)
- Capital (Human capital is the skillset for labour, while capital is the tools that businesses use)
- Entrepreneurship (Organizes previous three)

Self interest and social interest tensions:

- Globalization (Sustainable business, expansion of international trade, lending, and investment)
    + In the self-interest of multinational firms that outsource in low cost regions and sell in high price regions
- Information age economy
- Global warming and natural resource depletion
- Economic instability
    + Getting out of a recession

**Social interest**: Efficiency is achieved when the available resources are used to produce goods and services at the lowest possible price in quantities that give the greatest benefit

## Economic Way of Thinking

- A choice is a tradeoff
- People make rational choices by comparing benefits and costs
- Most choices are "how-much" choices made at the margin
- Choices respond to incentives

A **rational choice** is one that compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice.

The **opportunity cost** of something is the highest valued alternative that must be given up to get it.

To make a choice at the margin, you evaluate the consequences of making incremental changes in the use of time.

**Marginal benefit** is the benefit from incremental increase in an activity

**Marginal cost** is the opportunity cost of pursuing an incremental increase in an activity

If marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost, then the event is beneficial.

Changes in marginal cost/benefit change the incentives, and may lead to a change in choice

### Tradeoffs

- What tradeoffs arise when people choose how to spend their incomes
- How Tradeoffs arise when businesses choose among alternative production technologies.
- Whom tradeoffs arise when choices change the distribution of buying power across individuals

Government redistribution of income from the rich to the poor creates the **big tradeoff**: Tradeoff between equality and efficiency.

### Choices and Change

- Save money, buy more capital to increase production
- Less leisure time: Educate and train ourselves - productivity
- Less production, more research

The rule of law that protects private property and facilitates voluntary exchange in markets.

A **positive** statement can be tested against facts. A **normative** statement cannot be tested.

An **economic model** is a description of some aspect of the economic world that includes only those features that are needed for the purpose at hand. Simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes.

Economists are bad at testing economic models with facts so they use natural experiments, statistical investigations, and economic experiments.

# Lecture 2

The **production possibilities frontier** is the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot.

To show PPF, focus on two goods at a time and hold the quantities of all other goods and services constant.

Example: Cola vs pizza production in a month. With cola on $y$ axis and pizza on x axis, it's a graph with a negative slope that has the bounds fixed between $x$ and $y$ intercepts. At $y=0$, colas would be at $15$ million cans and it'll gradually decrease as more pizzas are manufactured.

Any point along a PPF graph should be attainable (including the area under the curve). Points along the PPF are efficient while points within the area under the curve are not.

We achieve **production efficiency** if we can't produce more of one good without producing less of some other good (produced at the lowest cost)

Since resources are not equally productive in all activities, the PPF is usually **concave**. As quantity produced increases, so does opportunity cost. This occurs because some resources are more suited for one job than another.

**Principle of decreasing marginal benefit:** General principle that the more we have of any good, the smaller its marginal benefit and the less we are willing to pay for additional unit of it.

Marginal benefit curve shows relationship between marginal benefit and quality of goods consumed. This is a linear graph with negative slope.

**Allocative efficiency** is when we can't produce more of any one good without giving up some other good that we value higher

The point of allocative efficiency is the point on the PPF at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost. This is when MB and MC intersect on the graph

## Economic Growth

Economic growth is the expansion of production possibilities and increase in standards of living. Mainly influenced by technology and capital.

**Technological change** is the development of new goods and of better ways of producing goods and services.

**Capital accumulation:** is the growth of capital resources, which include human capital.

To use resources in R&D, we must decrease production of consumption goods and services. Not free. Opportunity cost of growth is current consumption.

**Stock Pollutant:** accumulate in the environment while **Fund pollutant** either dilute to harmless levels or get transformed into harmless substances.

**Sustainability** is providing the typical person alive in the future with a standard of living at least as high as that enjoyed by the typical person today.

Neoclassical economists: Created capital substitutes for natural capital

Ecological economists: Created capital complement natural capital

**Comparative advantage** is an advantage for performing an activity at a lower opportunity cost than anyone else. (opportunity cost)

**Absolute advantage** is an advantage if the person is more productive than others (productivity)

## Gains from Trade


**Neoclassical approach:** Trade allows people to specialize in the production of goods for which they have a comparative advantage and then trade for goods other people produce.

Due to specialization, total output rises and can be shared <3

**Learn by doing** is when a person specializes by repeatedly producing a particular good or service and because more productive in it, lowering the opportunity cost.

**Dynamic comparative advantage** is when a person gains a comparative advantage from learning by doing.


Free trade is a system of trade policy that allows traders to trade across national boundaries without interference from the respective governments
(Prices would then be a reflection of true supply and demand)

Fair trade contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers - especially in the South.

Fair trade organizers are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.

## Economic Coordination

To reap the gains from trade, the choices of individuals must be coordinated. Four complimentary social institutions have evolved over the centuries

A **firm** is an economic unit that hires factors of production and organizes those factors to produce and sell goods and services.

A **market** is any arrangement that enables buyers and sellers to get information and do business with each other.

**Property rights** are the social arrangements that govern ownership, use, and disposal of resources, goods or services

**Money** is any commodity or token that is generally acceptable as a means of payment.

## Demand and Supply

**Prices act as incentive.**

Markets vary in the intensity of competition.

A **competitive market** is a market that has many buyers and many sellers so no single buyer or seller can influence the price.

The **money price** of a good or service is the number of dollars that must be given up for it.

A **relative price** is an opportunity cost. The ratio of one price to another is called a relative price.

Demand reflects a decision about which wants to satisfy. (Want it, can afford it, make plan to purchase)

## Law of Demand
Law of Demand: Other things renaming the same, the higher the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity demanded and viced versa.

**Substitution effect** is when the relative price (opportunity cost) of a good or service rises, people seek substitutions for it, so the quantity demanded of the good or service decreases.

**Income effect** is when the price of a good or service rises relative to income, people cannot afford all the things they previously bought, so the quantity demanded of the good or service decreases.

A **demand curve** shows that the relationship between the quantity demanded of a good and its price when all other influences on consumers' planned purchases remained the same.

When some influence on buying plans other than the price of the good changes, there is a **change in demand** for that good. When demand increases, the demand curve shifts rightward. When demand decreases, the demand curve shits leftward.

### Six factors that change demand

- Price of substitute products
- Expected future prices
- Income
- Expected future income and credit
- Population
- Preferences

A **complement** is a good that is used in conjunction with another good.

If the price of a good is expected to rise in the future, current demand for the good increases and the demand curve shifts rightward.

When income increases, consumers buy more and demand curve shifts rightward.

A **normal good** is one for which demand increases as income increases.

An **inferior good** is a good for which demand decreases as income increases.

## Supply

If a firm supplies a good/service, then it has resources and tech to produce it, can profit from it, and has made a definite plan to produce and sell it.

Resources and technology determine what it is possible to produce. Supply reflects a decision about which technologically feasible items to produce.

**Law of supply**: Higher price = higher quantity, lower price = lower quantity supplied (Cover marginal cost of production)

**Supply curve** shows relationship between quantity supplied of a good and its price when all other influences of a producers' planned sales remain the same.

A supply curve is also a **minimum-supply-price** curve. As quantity produced increases, marginal cost increases. Lowest price at which someone is willing to sell an additional unit rises. This lowest price is marginal cost.

When supply increases, supply curve shifts rightward, and when it decreases, shifts leftwards.

### Six factors that change supply

- Prices of factors of production
- Prices of related good produced
- Expected future prices
- Number of suppliers
- Technology
- State of nature

A substitute in production for a good is another good that can be produced using the same resources. Supply of a good increases if the price of a substitute in production falls or price of complement rises.

## Market Equilibrium

Equilibrium is a situation in which opposing forces balance each other. Occurs in market when price balances the plans of buyers and sellers.

**Equilibrium price** is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

**Equilibrium quantity** is the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.

- Price regulates buying and selling plans
- Price adjusts when plans don't match

Surplus forces price down, shortage forces the price up.

Change demand or supply changes the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.

Demand + --> equilibrium price rises and equilibrium quantity increases
Demand - --> equilibrium price falls and equilibrium quantity decreases

Supply + --> equilibrium price falls and equilibrium quantity decreases
Supply - --> equilibrium price rises and equilibrium quantity increases

Decrease in demand and increase in supply lowers the equilibrium price.

Decrease to supply and increase in demand increases the equilibrium price.

## Elasticity

The **price elasticity**  of demand is a units free measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price.

**Income elasticity** of demand measures how strong demanders respond to a change in income

**Cross elasticity** of demand measures how strongly demanders respond to change in price of another good

Elasticity is given by the slope of the derivative multiplied by the slope of two points.

$$ \frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}} $$

Percent change is change in $X$ over average of $X$ between two points.

**NOTE:** The demand elasticity formula yields a negative value because price and quantity move in the opposite directions. However, we are only interested in the magnitude of the price elasticity if demand to measure responsiveness.

If the elasticity is 0, the good has **perfectly inelastic demand**

If elasticity is infinity, the good has **perfectly elastic demand**

If percentage change in the quantity demanded equals  the percentage change in price, the price elasticity of demand is $1$ and is **unit elastic**.

If elasticity is less than $1$, it has inelastic demand. If elasticity is greater than $1$, it has elastic demand.

**NOTE:** For demand to be elastic, changes in price should yield big changes in demand.

Demand becomes less elastic as the price falls along a linear demand curve. When prices are above mid-point of the demand curve, demand is elastic. Otherwise it is inelastic.

Total revenue is maximized at the unit elastic point. If demand is elastic, reduce price to increase revenue. If demand is inelastic, increase price to increase revenue.

**Total revenue test** is a method of estimating the price elasticity of demand by observing the change in total revenue that results from a price change.

# Elasticity and Total Revenue

When the seller raises the price of a good, there are two effects

- Price effect: Units sell at higher price, raising revenue
- Quantity effect: Fewer units are sold, lowering revenue

If elastic, (quantity effect stronger than price effect). If inelastic, price effect stronger than quantity effect.

## Factors that effect elasticity

- Closeness of substitutes
    + Necessities generally have inelastic demand
    + Luxuries generally have elastic demand
- Proportion of income spent on the good
    + Greater proportion of income spent = larger elasticity of demand
- Time elapsed since a price change
    + The more time consumers have to adjust to a price change, the more elastic is the demand for the good

## Cross Elasticities of Demand

Cross elasticity of demand measures responsiveness of demand for a good to a change in the price of a substitute or a complement.

Formula is

$$\frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price of substitute or complement}}$$

Cross elasticity of demand for

- A **substitute** is positive
- A **complement** is negative

## Income Elasticity of Demand

The **income elasticity** measures how the quantity demanded of a good responds to change in income/

Formula is

$$\frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}\text{\% change in income}}$$

Income elastic, income inelastic has same criterias.

Income elasticity of demand is less than zero (negative), then the good is an **inferior good**.

## Elasticity of Supply

The **elasticity of supply** measures the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to a change in the price of a good.

Same formulas as demand

Elasticity of supply: $\frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}$

Perfectly inelastic, perfectly elastic (0 and infinite) and unit elastic (passes through origin)

Factors that influence elasticity of supply:

- Resource substitution possibilities (Easy to substitute, higher elasticity)
- Time frame for supply decision (More time = higher elasticity) (Momentary, short run, long run)

# Utility and Demand

Choices are determined by consumption possibilities and preferences

Benefit or satisfaction from consuming a good or service is **utility**

**Cardinal utility**: Utility gained from good can be measured and magnitude of measurement is meaningful. (Measured in utils)

Utilitarianism: Maximize happiness for greatest number of people

**Marginal Utility**: Change in total utility that results from one unit increase in the quantity of the good consumed

Diminishing marginal utility: Decreasing marginal utility

Utility Curve and Marginal Utility Curve (Derivative relation)

**Budget line** describes the limits to a household's consumption choices.

Eg: $8x + 4y = 40$ (x represents movie, y represents pop, 40 represents income)

An utility maximizing combination for spending is called **consumer equilibrium**

**Marginal utility per dollar** is literally marginal utility per dollar. (per price of good)

**Marginal Utility per dollar spend** is marginal utility from good by spending an additional dollar

To maximize utility, (Marginal utility per dollar) MU/P for unit A must be same as MU/P for unit B.

## Marginal Utility Theory

1. Fall in price of a substitute of a good decreases the demand for the good
2. Rise in income increases the demand for normal goods.


## Predictions of Marginal Utility Theory

When price of a good falls, quantity demanded increase, so MU/P if the good rises.

A change in price of one good changes the demand for another good. (Maximum total utility)
