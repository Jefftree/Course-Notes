## ECON 101

**Scarcity** is the inability to satisfy all wants. Must make **choices** based on **incentives**.

Economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile these choices.

**Variations**

- Alfred Marshall defines economics as the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.
- Jacob Viner: Economics is what economist do
- Jim Duesenberry: Economics is about how people make choices. Sociology is about why there isn't any choice to be made.
- John Maynard Keynes: The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, a technique of thinking that helps its possessors to draw correct conclusions.
- Lionel Robbin: Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

**Microeconomics:** Study of choices that individuals and businesses make, how those choices interact in markets, and the influence of governments.

**Macroeconomics:** Study of the overall performance of an economy (National and global).

**Goods and services** are the objects that people value and produce to satisfy human wants.

In China, agriculture accounts for 11%, manufactured goods 49%, and services 40%

In Canada, agriculture accounts for 2% of total production, manufactured goods 20%, and services 78%.


Goods and services are produced by using productive resources called **factors of production**. They are grouped into four categories

- Land (Gift of nature)
- Labour (Time and effort)
- Capital (Human capital is the skillset for labour, while capital is the tools that businesses use)
- Entrepreneurship (Organizes previous three)

Self interest and social interest tensions:

- Globalization (Sustainable business, expansion of international trade, lending, and investment)
    + In the self-interest of multinational firms that outsource in low cost regions and sell in high price regions
- Information age economy
- Global warming and natural resource depletion
- Economic instability
    + Getting out of a recession

**Social interest**: Efficiency is achieved when the available resources are used to produce goods and services at the lowest possible price in quantities that give the greatest benefit

## Economic Way of Thinking

- A choice is a tradeoff
- People make rational choices by comparing benefits and costs
- Most choices are "how-much" choices made at the margin
- Choices respond to incentives

A **rational choice** is one that compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice.

The **opportunity cost** of something is the highest valued alternative that must be given up to get it.

To make a choice at the margin, you evaluate the consequences of making incremental changes in the use of time.

**Marginal benefit** is the benefit from incremental increase in an activity

**Marginal cost** is the opportunity cost of pursuing an incremental increase in an activity

If marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost, then the event is beneficial.

Changes in marginal cost/benefit change the incentives, and may lead to a change in choice

### Tradeoffs

- What tradeoffs arise when people choose how to spend their incomes
- How Tradeoffs arise when businesses choose among alternative production technologies.
- Whom tradeoffs arise when choices change the distribution of buying power across individuals

Government redistribution of income from the rich to the poor creates the **big tradeoff**: Tradeoff between equality and efficiency.

### Choices and Change

- Save money, buy more capital to increase production
- Less leisure time: Educate and train ourselves - productivity
- Less production, more research

The rule of law that protects private property and facilitates voluntary exchange in markets.

A **positive** can be tested against facts. A **normative** statement cannot be tested.

An **economic model** is a description of some aspect of the economic world that includes only those features that are needed for the purpose at hand. Simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes.

Economists are bad at testing economic models with facts so they use natural experiments, statistical investigations, and economic experiments.

# Lecture 2

The **production possibilities frontier** is the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot.

To show PPF, focus on two goods at a time and hold the quantities of all other goods and services constant.

Example: Cola vs pizza production in a month. With cola on $y$ axis and pizza on x axis, it's a graph with a negative slope that has the bounds fixed between $x$ and $y$ intercepts. At $y=0$, colas would be at $15$ million cans and it'll gradually decrease as more pizzas are manufactured.

Any point along a PPF graph should be attainable (including the area under the curve). Points along the PPF are efficient while points within the area under the curve are not.

We achieve **production efficiency** if we can't produce more of one good without producing less of some other good (produced at the lowest cost)

Since resources are not equally productive in all activities, the PPF is usually **concave**. As quantity produced increases, so does opportunity cost. This occurs because some resources are more suited for one job than another.

**Principle of decreasing marginal benefit:** General principle that the more we have of any good, the smaller its marginal benefit and the less we are willing to pay for additional unit of it.

Marginal benefit curve shows relationship between marginal benefit and quality of goods consumed. This is a linear graph with negative slope.

**Allocative efficiency** is when we can't produce more of any one good without giving up some other good that we value higher
